# Specification Quality Checklist: Package Manifest & Install

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## BDD Readiness

- [x] Acceptance scenario summary tables defined for each user story
- [x] Scenario titles are specific enough to drive .feature file generation during /speckit.plan

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- Version ranges (^, ~) explicitly deferred — exact versions only for this feature.
- Only `instructions` type supported initially; other types reserved but rejected with clear error.
- Breaking change to `.ailign.yml` packages format is acceptable pre-v1.0.0 per constitution.
